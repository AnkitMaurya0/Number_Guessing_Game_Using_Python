ðŸ“˜ Project 2: Number Guessing Game

âœ… Purpose:
Make a game where the computer selects a number, and the user keeps guessing until correct.

ðŸ§  Concepts Used:

1. random module:
   âž¤ Used to generate random numbers.
   âž¤ Syntax: random.randint(start, end)

2. Variables:
   âž¤ Store values like secret_number and guess.

3. while loop:
   âž¤ Repeats a block of code while a condition is true.
   âž¤ Used here to keep asking the user to guess.

4. if-elif-else statements:
   âž¤ Checks multiple conditions.
   âž¤ Tells user if their guess is too low, too high, or correct.

ðŸ›  Example Output:
Guess a number between 1 and 10: 5
Too high! Try again.
Guess a number between 1 and 10: 3
ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! You guessed it right.
